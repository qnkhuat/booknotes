### Chapter 1 -- introduction

This book is about learning when and why to use Macros.

Focus on combinations of macros -- one of the area that CS research haven't fully explored because it frightens researchers.

> Coding style is necessary only where understanding is missing
Style is more like guideline for novice programmers, once we reached understanding we no longer need the guideline.

### Chapter 2 -- Closures

The book name `let over lambda` is another name for lexical scoping or Closure.

Lisp and clojure has both lexical scoped and dynamically scoped variable.
In clojure it's defined by assigning a meta `:dynamic`

Python doesn't have dynamic scoped, so that's why you can't do the same thing as you do with dynamic var in Clojure.
